# Info.plist properties - notes

### Troubleshooting: NSContactsUsageDescription

If you get an error messsage such as:

    [access] This app has crashed because it attempted to access
    privacy-sensitive data without a usage description. The app's
    Info.plist must contain an NSContactsUsageDescription key with
    a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data.

Then you must configure the application properties to use 
NSContactsUsageDescription and provide a suitable text message.


### Troubleshooing: Xcode 13 properties and Info.plist

In Xcode 13, you edit properties this way:

  * Project -> Targets -> Info -> Custom iOS Target Properties

  * Hover over any item. You see a tiny plus icon and minus icon.

  * Click the plus icon. You can create any property you want.

IMHO this UI/UX is subpar because it's hard to discover,
and the process is quite different than the older process,
which used a big "+" icon at the top of each list section.

The first time you add/edit, Xcode will automatically generate
a new Info.plist file thatâ€™s kind of synced1 with Custom iOS
Target Properties. Xcode will later merge them for you.

Caution: the properties are not fully synced. Some properties
such as NSCameraUsageDescription will only appear in Custom iOS
Target Properties, while Application requires iPhone environment
will appear in both. TODO: how does Xcode determine this?

Some developers prefer to create a file Info.plist,
and use the older conventions for editing properties.


### Troubleshooing: Xcode 12 properties and Info.plist

In Xcode 12, you edit properties this way:

   * Select your project.

   * In the left side of the middle pane, select your app under "Targets"

   * Select the tab "Build Settings"

   * Search the following keywords: "info. plist" and "pch"

   * Choose the ones that you want to modify.

   * Click on "Validate Settings" and you're done.
