# Technical questions

We have technical questions and welcome advice from experienced developers: 

  * How can iOS Swift detect if a CNContact has FaceTime capabilties? 

  * How can the app ensure that open("facetime://â€¦") succeeds, then after the call the person is returned to the app?
  
  * What are good ways to test the implementations of Swift protocols and extensions?
