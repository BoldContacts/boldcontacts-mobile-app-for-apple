# Roadmap

2022-09: Beta test the iOS app, and add test code as needed. If you would like a beta testing invitation, and you have a current iPhone or iPad, then please email joel@joelparkerhenderson.com.

2022-10: Launch in the Apple iOS App Store. Handle launch annoucements, feedback, issues, etc.

2022-11: Start development on an Android version.  

Future ideas:

* Add hardware buttons. For example add two cheap generic BLE buttons: 'next contact' with wraparound, and 'call now' that automatically starts a video call. This means the phone can be docked, and the person can skip any the steps of phone unlocking, or fingerprint reading, or accessibily taps. This also means the photo can be full screen. Full quote: "I'd suggest adding some ability for the app to be driven by hardware buttons. Then make the image full screen. Two cheap generic BLE buttons, one for 'next contact' (wraparound) and one for call -- then automatically start a video call. Then the phone can be docked and all the BS of unlocking or fingerprint reading, or any of the other accessibility assumptions can be ignored."

* Figure out water-proofing and drop-proofing. Imagine holding a drink in your hand, having hand tremors, forgetting about your drink, then trying to tap your phone-- which makes you spill your drink, then drop your phone. We want ways to help this.
  
* Add configuration capabilties. For example make it possible in the app to hide/show a contact, or add a photo to a contact, or set a contact to prefer FaceTime video. Full quote: "Keeping the interface very simple is essential, but you might consider adding some config within the app instead of relying on setup within the Contacts app. So, maybe add a ... button to the top of each contact where a popup window could be used to select the call action or to exclude that contact from the list altogether."
  
* Research text-to-speech. Full quote: "You might also try Text to Speech to say the contact's name after a slight delay."
