#  BoldContacts

BoldContacts is an app is a greatly-simpler way to browse contacts and connect to them.

BoldContacts is especially good for people who may be experiencing vision disabiltiies, cognitive disabiltiies, or motor disabiltiies. The app displays each contact with a large photo, large text, and large buttons.
 
BoldContacts started because my family members have Alzheimer's disease and Parkison's disease, and are unable to use the typical contacts app. My hope is BoldContacts helps them.
