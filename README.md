#  BoldContacts

BoldContacts is an app is a greatly-simpler way to browse contacts and connect to them.

BoldContacts is good for people experiencing vision disabiltiies, cognitive disabilties, or motor disabiltiies. The app displays each contact with a large photo, large text, and large buttons.
 
BoldContacts started because my family members have Alzheimer's disease and Parkison's disease, and are unable to use the typical contacts app. My hope is BoldContacts helps them.
