# BoldContacts

BoldContacts is an app that helps you browse your contacts and connect with them.

BoldContacts is intended for people who experience vision disabilities, cognitive disabilities, or motor disabilities. The app displays each contact with a large photo, large text, and large buttons.
 
BoldContacts started because our family members have Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and are unable to use the typical contacts app. BoldContacts helps our family keep in touch, and helps caretakers connect with us.


## Beta Testing

BoldContacts is currently doing beta testing of the iOS app. If you would like a beta testing invitation, and you have a current iPhone or iPad, then please email joel@joelparkerhenderson.com.

The app shows each contact's photo and name.

Two buttons navigate backward/forward in the contacts.

One button connects. This can use your choice of FaceTime video, or a phone call, or an email message, or a custom URL.


## Setup

The first time you launch BoldContats, you will see an Apple iOS prompt that asks for you to approve this access.

Say yes.


## Personalization

You can personalize how your BoldContacts app will connect to your contact:

1. Launch your typical Apple Contacts app, and edit the contact.

2. Create a new contact field i.e. phone number, or email address, or URL address.

3. Edit the new contact field label to be "BoldContacts".
