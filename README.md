#  BoldContacts

BoldContacts is an app is a greatly-simpler way to browse contacts and connect to them.

BoldContacts is especially good for people who may be experiencing vision disabiltiies, cognitive disabiltiies, or motor disabiltiies. The app displays each contact by using bold text, a large photo, large buttons, and one way to connect.
 
BoldContacts started as a project to help my family's parents, who are experiencing Alzheimer's disease and Parkison's disease, and who were losing the ability to work with the typical contacts app. We created the app to be much simpler, and to be open source so other developers can work with the code to help people.
