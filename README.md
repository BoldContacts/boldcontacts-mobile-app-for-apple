BoldContacts™ is an app that helps you browse your contacts and connect with them.

BoldContacts is intended for people who experience vision disabilities, cognitive disabilities, or motor disabilities. The app displays each contact with a large photo (if available), large font, and large buttons.
 
BoldContacts started because our family members have recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and are now unable to use the typical contacts app. The app may also help people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Muscular Distrophy (MD), and more.

BoldContacts helps our family keep in touch, and helps caretakers connect with us. We hope it may help you and your loved ones. We welcome constructive feedback. We are actively seeking donations and grants to work on accessibility software full time. Contact Joel Parker Henderson at [joel@joelparkerhenderson.com](mailto:joel@joelparkerhenderson.com)


## How it works

<img src="screenshot.png" height="300">

The app shows each contact's photo and name.

There is a phone icon button that means "call now". This connects using your choice of video, or phone, or email, or message, or custom URL. A caregiver can customize this by using the default iOS Contacts app.

There is a left-arrow icon button that means ""previous contact", and a right-arrow icon button that means "next contact". These navigate backward/forward through the list of contacts. 

The buttons are purposefully far apart, to help people see them better, and to help people be able to tap each button separately.


## Roadmap

BoldContacts is currently doing beta testing of the iOS app, and working on testing code. If you would like a beta testing invitation, and you have a current iPhone or iPad, then please email joel@joelparkerhenderson.com.

Next up we are creating an Android version.  

Future ideas:

* Add hardware buttons. For example add two cheap generic BLE buttons: 'next contact' with wraparound, and 'call now' that automatically starts a video call. This means the phone can be docked, and the person can skip any the steps of phone unlocking, or fingerprint reading, or accessibily taps. This also means the photo can be full screen. 


## Setup

The first time you launch BoldContats, you will see an Apple iOS prompt that asks for you to approve this access.

Say yes.


## Personalization

You can personalize how your BoldContacts app will connect to your contact:

1. Launch your typical Apple Contacts app, and edit the contact.

2. Create a new contact field i.e. phone number, or email address, or URL address.

3. Edit the new contact field label to be "BoldContacts".
