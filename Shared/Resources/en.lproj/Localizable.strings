// This section is for prompt responses such as for button labels.
//
// For example, the app displays a dialog box that shows a prompt
// says "Do you want to do X?" and also shows various buttons that
// say "Yes" | "No", or "OK" | "Cancel", or other alternatives.
//
// These prompts always ask the current user about the current action.
// These response phrases always must be be personal and immediate.
//
// If your language has various choices for these prompt responses,
// then please choose wording that uses second person imperative,
// because the purpose is a direct order from the user to the app,
// such as the user telling the app "You do this now".
